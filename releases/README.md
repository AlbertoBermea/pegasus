Marks the official support for the API.


We changed version numbering, jumping from previous version 1.44.x, to correctly reflect ```major```, ```minor``` and ```patch``` concepts:

```

Breaking changes may occurr on ```mayor``` and ```minor``` numbers. ```Patches```, are not expected to affect compatibility.
