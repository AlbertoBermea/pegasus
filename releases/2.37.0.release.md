# 2.37.x - Release Notes
*Original release: October 1 - 2018*

*Last update: October 10 - 2018*

### API

##### Fixed

* Fixed, GET [/console?cid](https://pegasus1.pegasusgateway.com/api/docs/#api-remote-RemoteConsoleCmdResp) response

##### Changed

* Changed, the event code generated when a user sends a query location, changed from 99 to 98, the label is still the same: `position`. 
POST [api/vehicles/:vid/remote/trigger_position_event](https://pegasus1.pegasusgateway.com/api/docs/#api-remote-RemoteTriggerPositionEvent)

This will help distinguish between user generated location query's and auto generated queries by the system for trip purposes.
